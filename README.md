Click the repository with my username and then click script.lua for GustavOS (WOS Microcontroler OS) and copy the raw link and paste in a Microcontroller, you also cant have 2 or more ports with the same id or a id higher than 128, if you want the shutdown button to actually shutdown you need a deactivate polysilicon connected to a port and the microcontroller without a ethernet cable.
