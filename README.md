Click the repository with my username and then click script.lua for GustavOS (WOS Microcontroler OS) and copy the raw link and paste in a Microcontroller, you also cant have 2 or more ports with the same id or a id higher than 128, if you want a shutdown button in the start menu you need a polysilicon connected to a port without a ethernet cable and the microcontroller.
